Yo, I'm Eduardo Paix√£o, also known as "Px". I am currently an IT student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, focusing on cyber security and computer networks.

I was working with network infrastructure at [*SINFO*](https://info.ufrn.br/) performing networks and security tasks. Presently im member of cyberdef labs where i work solving security issues of my college.

Majority of my software projects are open, you can look at them on my [github](https://github.com/duardopx/).

I spend my free time reading books and trying learn harmonica and skate.

If you want to talk with me, feel free to send me an email at **duardopx@protonmail.com**.
